## DIGITAL COMMUNICATION RECEIVER

<p>Digital communication system is used to transport an information bearing
signal from the source to a user destination via a communication channel.Every
communication channel is exposed to different kinds of noise sources which cause some
loss or changes in the data transmitted over the channel. The problem arises when you
discover that the received data has been corrupted and you have to retransmit the whole
data again. However retransmission is not an acceptable idea. This project will allow the
receiver to detect and correct them without the need of retransmission. Deep space and
satellite communications network, broadband modems, digital televisions etc., fields have
the application of this project.</p>
